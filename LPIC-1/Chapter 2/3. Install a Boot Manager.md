**Grand Unified Boot Loader (GRUB) on MBR**
![[BIOS.png]]

>[!info]+ Steps of booting up a kernel using the BIOS
>1. After powered on, the BIOS will check if all the hardware is good to go, and then will locate the `boot.img` in the first 512 bytes of the hard disk (this is the disk that is flagged with the boot flag) which is the `MBR - Master Bootloader - GRUB`
>2. The `boot.img` will then locate `core.img`, the location of `core.img` is an empty space toward the end of the boot record that will be used to boot the actual boot partition for the system.
>3. Within `/boot/grub` directory on a Legacy GRUB system, the GRUB program file is looking for `grub.conf` on `Red Hat distribution` or `menu.lst` on `Debian-based distribution`. `grub.conf` and `menu.lst` contains instruction on how to boot the OS. It interprets the configuration directives nad prepares to load the specified `Kernel` and `initial RAM Disk`.
>4. `device.map` is also important as it contains the location of the kernel that will be booted, after the file is read, the kernel will be loaded by GRUB. It stores the mapping of `BIOS` device names (`hd0, hd1`) with the corresponding disk or partition identifiers (such as `/dev/sda, /dev/nvme0n1`)

**Installing GRUB**

`findmnt /boot`: Find a device to install GRUB onto. The device can be `/dev/sda` or `/dev/hdo`.
`grub-install [device]`: To install GRUB onto a device.
`grub`: to enter the grub configuration command line, **in and only in this command line** exists some command for the GRUB configuration:

>[!warning]+ Root in GRUB:
>GRUB configuration considers the `/boot` mountpoint to be the `root` location. Therefore, everything we looking for is relative to `/boot` location. 
>Meaning that we dont use `/boot/grub/stage1` but `/grub/stage1` only.

- `find /grub/stage1`: search for a file in all partition and list the devices the file is on.
- `quit`: Exit grub shell

**GRUB2**

**Differences between MBR and GRP**
`MBR - Master Boot Record`: traditionally supported only 26 total partitions (4 partitions, with one partition extended to 23 partitions) and the partition size limited to 2TB.

`GPT - GUID Partition Table`: Support 128 partitions with partition size up in the ZB(zettabye) range, and needs `UEFI - Unified Extensible Firmware Interface` to boot.

>[!info]+ UEFI vs BIOS:
>+ UEFI is the replacement for traditional BIOS, can act in legacy BIOS mode.
>+ Requires a 64-bit OS.
>+ Prevents unauthorized OS from booting on the system.


>[!info]+ Steps of booting up a kernel using UEFI
>1. After powered on, the UEFI will check that all the input and output hardware are ready, and then will locate the `Master Boot Record` in the first 512 bytes of the hard disk and locate for the `boot.img` file.
>2. After that, the UEFI will create 2 empty arrays, `GPT Header` - which will tells the system that we are using the GPT style disk, and the `Partition Entry Array` - which is a large disk of the partition and the ID of the partition and where they are located.
>3. There will also be an empty sector which is for the `core.img` file.
>4. The `core.img` file will look for the `boot EFI partition` this is known as the `EFI System Partition` or `ESP`, and it has to be either a `VFAT` or `FAT32`, format file system. It has to be this format as this is the only file type that `EFI` and `UEFI` can be read from.
>5. After the image from the EFI partition is read, `GRUB` now enter stage 2, under `/boot/grub2`, the two main files in this directory is `grubenv` and `themes`

##### GRUB2 Configuration commands

+ `grub2-editenv list`: view the default boot entry for the grub configuration file.
+ `grub2-mkconfig`: creates (or update) a `/boot/grub2/grub.cfg` file based on entries from the `/etc/default/grub` file
`=>` On Debian systems, thelocation is `/boot/grub/grub.cfg`
