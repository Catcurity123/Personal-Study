**The Main File System Locations**
+ `/`: Bottom of the directory tree, the `root`.
+ `/var`: the variable location, log file, and dynamic content (such as web sites) are often found here.
+ `/home`: The users' home directory, where personal files are stored
+ `/boot`: The boot directory, where the Linux kernel and supporting files are stored.
+ `/opt`: Location used for `optional` software, often used by third-party software vendors. Enterprise environments make extensive use of this location.

**Swap Space**
+ Swap is a temporary storage that acts like RAM, when a percentage of RAM is full, the kernel will move less used data to swap.
+ Swap partition (most common setup)
+ Swap file (similar to the page file on a Window OS)
+ Much slower performance than using a dedicated partition, as it is writing straight to the hard disk.
+ Older `rules of thumb` ranges from 1.5x to 2.0x the size of your available RAM.
+ Nowadays, its up to you but no less than 50% of available RAM.

**Partition and Mount Points**
+ Partition is the act of creating some space out of the existing hard disk.
![[partition.png]]

+ We can create multiple partitions out of one storage device.

+ `Partition`, however, is just the act of dividing a disk into smaller parts of it, to make the partitions usable, we need to `mount` the disk to a specific directory.

**Some commands**
`mount`: Can be used to mount partitions to directories, or show all existing mounts without any options.

`lsblk`: Short for list block, used to show all block devices on a system and their name
![[lsblk_2.png]]

`fdisk -l /dev/diskname`: Short for fixed disk, can be used to list out partition information on the specific disk, including size, unit size, label, identifier and whether or not it is a boot disk.
**=>** The `diskname` can either be `xvd` short for `Xen Virtual Disk` or `nvme` short for `Non-Violatile Memory Express`. Each of these device has their own naming convention:
![[fdisk.png]]

1. `xvda1` means the first partition of the first `xvd` storage device, similarly, `xvdb1` means the first partition of the second `xvd` storage device
2. `nvme0n1p1` means the first partition of the first namespace of the first `nvme` storage device, similarly, `nvme1n1p1` means the first partition of the first namespace of the second `nvme` storage device.

`swapon --summary`: Shows a summary of the swap usage on a system, same information can be found in `/proc/swaps`. The type of data can either be a `swap file` or a `swap partition`.

>[!Info]+ Difference between `swap file` and `swap partition`:
>+ `Swap partition` is a dedicated partition on a hard disk or SSD that is used exclusively for swapping, they are generally faster and more reliable than swap files
>+ `Swap file` is a special file that is created on a file system and used for swapping. they may be slower and less reliable than `swap partition`. One advantage of using a `swap file` is that it can be created and resized dynamically, without the need to repartition the disk.
