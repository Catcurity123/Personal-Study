+ All UNIX-like OS have something like a bucket where all output goes.
+ This `bucket` is called standard output.

+ For `stdout` we redirect an output of a command to another file using `> or >>`.
+ For `stdin` we redirect our input to another command using `< or |`
+ For `stderr` it is typically written to the screen

+ `stderr` has a `file handle` number associated with it: `2`
+ `stdin` has a number of `0` and `stdout` is `1`

Therefore, we can redirect the output, or the error of a script to the screen or to another file.

Let's say our script is partially done, we can redirect the correct output to a file, the error to a file to view them separately.

Or we can redirect both of them into a log file.

>[!Note] It is crucial to remember the order of command.
>In `./stderr.sh` The `stdeer` and `stdout` will be printed onto the initial location of the `standard output` of the script, which is the screen. Therefore, if we `./stderr.sh 2>&1 > log.log` it will print the error (`2>`) on the screen and print the output (`&1`) onto the file log as the initial location of `2>` is the screen and the initial location of `&1` is the log file.
>Therefore, we must write it `./stderr.sh > log.log 2>&1` so that the initial location of the script is the log file and `2>&1` will be printed onto log.log


```
#!/bin/bash
echo "This is stand"
echo "This is standerr" > &2
```


#### More redirection

(+) `tee`: reads data fron sdin and writes that data to stdout and files.
`ls -d /usr/share/doc/lib[Xx]* | tee lib-docs.txt | sort -r | tee lib-docs-revs.txt`: => command | tee | command | tee, takes input of the command, print it onto the screen and in a file.

(+) `xargs`: accepts input from stdin and other commands. Commonly used with the `find` command.
=> `find test/ -empty | xargs rm -f `
=> `grep -l "junk test/file_* | xargs -I {} mv {} test/bak/`
