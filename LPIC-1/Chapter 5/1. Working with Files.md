#### File and Folder Compression

`=>` `dd if=boot.img of=/dev/sdc bs=512 count=1`; copy and convert boot.img to /dev/sdc which has block size of 512 and count = 1.
`=>` `dd if=/dev/urandom of=file bs =1024k count=10`

+ `tar`: tape archive, wraps up files and folders into an archive, which is called `tar balls`
`=>` `tar -cf test-bck.tar Test`: create a file `test-bck.tar` from `Test`. (create file)
`=>` `tar -tf test-bck.tar`: view content without extracting the archive. (test file)
`=>` `tar -xf test-bck.tar`: extract the archive.

+ `gz compresison`: compress and create a `.gz` file
`=>` `tar -cvzf file.tar.gz dir`: create a gz file out of a `FOLDER`
`=>` `tar -xzf file.tar.gz`: Extract gz file
`=>` `gzip file`: create a gz file out of a `FILE`
`=>` `gunzip file`: extract the gz file

+ `bzip2 compression`: compress and create a `.bz2` file
`=>` `tar -cvjf file.tar.bz2 dir`: create a bz2 file out of a `FOLDER`
`=>` `tar -xvjf file.tar.bz2`: Extact Verbose Bzip2 Filename file.tar.bz2
`=>` `bzip2 file`: create a bz2 file out of a `FILE`
`=>` `bunzip2 file`: extract the bz2 file

+ `xz` compress and creates .xz files
`=>` `tar -cvJf archive.tar.xz dir`: create a xz file out of a `FODLER`
`=>` `tar -xvJf archive.tar.xz`: extract the compressed dir.
`=>` `xz file`:
`=>` `unxz file`: extract xz file.

>[!Note] `tar` is used to compressed directory, other tools is used to compress file

#### To read compressed file without extracting it

`zcat + filename`: for gzip file
`bzcat + filename`: for bzip2 file
`xzcat + filename`: for xz file
