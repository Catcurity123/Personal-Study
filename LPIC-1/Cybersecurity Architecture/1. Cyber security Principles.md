#### A. Defense in Depth
(+) Not relying on any single security mechanism to keep the system safe.

(+) Implement defense in various stages so that there is no single point of failure and if it fails, it fail safely.

#### B. Least Priviledge
(+) Grant permission only necessary and sufficient for entity to do what it supposed to do for a given time. `this is called least priviledge`
(+) The system also should not contains things that it dont need, for example it does not use FTP or does not use a port it should be exclude and default names on the system should be changed. `this is called hardening the system`.
(+) Modification to entity's priviledge should be evaluated based on the entity's role, nothing more, nothing less to `prevent priviledge creep`

#### C. Separation of Duty
(+) No single point of control, the requester must not be the approver.

#### D. Secure by desgin
(+) Security should be implemented from every stage of the project/product, implementing it only at the end is not ideal.

![[Pasted image 20240424133204.png]]==> Secure from start to finish, secure by design, secure out of the box.

#### E. Keep It Simple Stupid
(+) Dont make it harder than necessary because that will make it easier for the bad guys and harder for the good guys.
==> Making it to complex will encourage people to use trick to overcome it which will be opposite of what we are inteded to do
![[Pasted image 20240424134438.png]]==> `COMPLEXITY IS THE ENEMY OF SECURITY`

#### Security by Obscurity should be avoid
(+) Relying on some sort of secret knowledge in order to make the system safe is caled `Seuciry by Obscurity`

==> `SECRECY IS NOT SECURITY`

(+) `Kerckhoff principle` states that the security of a cryptographic system shouldn't rely on the secrecy of the algorithm

==> This means we should not rely on `black box system` to ensure our security, the what and how of security should be known and the only secret should be the key.
==> We want `glass box security` not `black box security`
