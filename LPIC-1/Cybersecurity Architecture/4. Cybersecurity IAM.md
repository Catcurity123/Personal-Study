#### A. 4 As
(+) `Administration` what access rights you have and created those
(+) `Authentication` where we determine who u are
(+) `Authorization` where we determine what u can do
(+) `Audit` where we evaluate whether we have done the above 3

#### B. Stages of IAM
##### 1. Base stage (Store & Sync)
(+) User can be group into groups, each of them has their ID and access right, these information, the name of the users, the group, their ID, access right are refered to as `user's identity`.

(+) These `identity` is stored in a `directory`, so that these information can be looked up to support the `4 As`.
(+) The `directory` therefore can be in a form of a `database` with different `schema` to represent information. And there is a protocol to query the data regarding IAM which is `Lightweight Directory Access Control - LDAP`
==> Active Directory is Microsoft's IAM directory that uses LDAP.

==> In a perfect scenario, we would have an `enterprise directory` where we would store these information and uses it, but in real life we have different directory for each different departments ==> There needs to be a way to query information from different directory

(+) If we can not get everything in one place, we can think about synchronizing them into a `virtual directory`. We can use metadata to get sufficient information from department's directory into the virtual enterprise directory for usage

##### 2. Application stages
(+) Application stage refers to the capabilities of an IAM system to perform tasks in accordance to the 4 As.

###### 2.1 Administration
(+) Administration application refers to the creation, provision, and deletion as well as the ability to observe or traceback user's identity.
(+) Creation process usually goes through HR procedure and stores in HR directory, we will fetch those data, assign them with a roled, create a request and get the approval before we assign them.
(+) Provision refers to the assigning of additional roles to existing employee
(+) Deletion refers to the deprovision of priviledge for retired employee

###### 2.2 Authentication and Authorization
(+) `Authentication` answer the question `Who Are You`, based on what you know (password), what you have (mobile phone MFA), and what you are (biometric, face regconition, fingerprint).
==> A good authentication system does not rely on 1 single method, but a combination of at least 2, refered to as `MFA`
==> Moving towards `passwordless` and `SSO - Single Signed On`

(+) `Authorization` answer the question `What can you do`, Authorization system nowadays, uses technology called `Risk-based authorization (RBA)` and `Adaptive Access (AA)`.
==> Not as simple as u can do it or not, but you might do it, but under some circumstances or condition with limitation on `location, request type, request amount, frequency`

`There is a special type of access management for priviledged entities`

###### 2.3 Access management for priviledged entity
(+) Access management for priviledged entity can be done using `Priviledged Access Management - PAM` system. 
(+) Instead of logging right into the system, priviledged entity will log into a PAM system using allocated credentials (with MFA enabled), then the PAM system will allow access to the critical systems, after finished PAM system will change the password of the critical systems.

###### 2.4 Audit
(+) `Audit` refers to the ability of accessing whether the security measures work as expected.
(+) To assess user behaviours we can implement `User Behaviors Analytics - UBA` to spot anomalies pattern

###### 2.5 Federation Capabilities
(+) This refers to the ability to establish trust relationships between different identity domains or systems, allowing users from one system (identity provider) to access resources and services in another system (service provider)
==> An employee needs to access Cloud provider for example
#### Summary
(+) All of these things in combination are called `Enterprise Identity and Access Management`
