#### A. Confidentiality
(+) Consist of 2 mains factor `Access Control` and `Encryption`

###### 1. Access Control 
(+) Consist of `Authentication` and `Authorization`
(+) `Authentication` answers the question `Who are you`, it can be enforced using `MFA` which is something u knows, something u have, something you are or combination of them and `RBA - Role based Access Control` which means an entity has its priviledge of what it can do.

###### 2. Encryption
(+) Keep unwanted entity from reading or retrieving encrypted information.

#### B. Integrity
(+) Is the quality that says a message is true to itself, if it is modified, we can detect it, if it is detected then we can know not to trust that and take appropriate countermeasure.

(+) This can be done using logging system. But if a malicious entity elavate its priviledge and delete logs, we can use `DIG SIG - digital signature and MAC - message authentication code` to detect this.

#### C. Availability
(+) The user can get access when they need it.
(+) This can be tampered using DOS, DDOS, and SYN Flood.
