#### Viewing files
+ To view file: `cat + <file name> + <file name> (if more)`
+ To view less for a file: `cat + <file name> | less`
+ Display the first 10 lines of a file: `head + <file name>`
+ Display the last 10 lines of a file: `tail + <file name>` `tail -15 + <file name>`

`=>` Sysadm usually use tail to display log file of the system: `sudo tail -f /var/log/secure`.

+ To view gzip compressed text files: `zcat + <file name>`
+ To view bzat compressed text files: `bzcat + <file name>`
+ To view xzcat compressed text files: `xzcat + <file name>`

#### Text file Statistics.
+ To view the number of lines in a file: `nl + <file name>`. `-b a` to include blank line.
+ To count words in a file: `wc + <file name>`. `-w` for words, `-l` for lines, `-c` for byte counts.
+ To octal dump a file: `od + <file name>` to show the acutal content of the fil in octal format. `-c` to view aharacter, `-a` to view as ascii.

#### Message Digests
+ To calculates and cheks a file's hash based on MD5 algorithm: `md5sum`.
`=>` `md5sum helloworld.c > test.md5` to produce a md5 text of helloworld.c
`=>` `md5sum -c test.md5` to test the current file with the produced md5 text.

+ To calculates and check a file's hash based on sha256 algorithm: `sha256sum`
`=>` `sha256sum helloworld.c > test.sha256` then `sha256 -c test.sha256`

+ To calculates and cheks a file's hash based on sha512 algo: `sha512sum
`=>` `sha512sum helloworld.c > test.sha512` then `sha512 -c test.sha512`

#### Text Manipulation
+ To sort and merge lines of a file: `sort + <file name>`. 
`=>` `-n` to consider the column as a whole number, not jsut the fist number.  
`=>` `-t` to specifies the delimeter that will be used and then `-k + <column number>` to sort the column number.
`Example`: `sort -t "," -k+{row} list.csv`

+ Displays unique lines of file: `uniq`.
`=>` By defaults `uniq` only discard consecutive value. `uniq -c` to see how items are counted and `uniq --group` to visualize how they are counted.
`=>` To display unique line of iles, we use `sort -u + <filename>` this will disregard grouping and only print out unique value.

+ To translate characters in a file for another character: `tr`.
`=>` This command needs an input to be pipe in. `cat list.csv | tr ',' ':'`
`=>` To remove the delimeter we use. `cat list.csv | tr -d ','`
`=>` Translate all upper case to lower case `cat list.csv | tr 'A-Z' 'a-z'`

`=>` We can pipe one output after another and after another: `cat list.csv | tr 'A-Z' 'a-z' | tr -d ','`

+ To extract columns or fields of data from a file, by doing this we identify the delimeter, and see each field as a file with number starting from 1: `cut -d',' -f 3 list.csv` 
`=>` By default the delimeter of `cut` is `\t`
`=>` To add more filed simple: `cut -d',' -f 2,3 list.csv`
`=>` We can combine multiple command using pipe: `cat list.csv | tr ',' '\t' | cut -f 2,3`

+ To merge lines of files in parallel: `paste <file1> <file2>`.
+ To merge serially: `paste -d ',' -s <file1> <file2>`
