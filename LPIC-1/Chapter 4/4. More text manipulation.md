#### `SED` command
+ `Stream Editor` command, used for a variety of tasks, commonly utilized to alter text in a file or search and replace words. This, unlike `cat`, `tr`, or `cut`, will replace the content of a file.
+ To remove a content permanently: `sed -i 's/desktop/workstation/g' list.csv` will replace the word `dektop` by `workstation` `globally` in the list.csv file.
+ With out the `-i` option this will not replace but will print the output out only.
+ `sed -i "s/<word1>/<word2>/Ig <filename>"` to replace word case insentivity globally.

#### `Split` command
+ Command that is used to split a file up into individual pieces.
+ To split files into pieces under a certain amount of bytes: `split -b 100 fable.txt`, depending on file size, we can specify the amount of each piece `split -b 100M (or 100K or 100G) fable.txt`
