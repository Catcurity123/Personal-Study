#### Environment Variables:

Setting that dictates common functionality and locations for various purposes
+ Syntax: `Variable=path,command,alias` => `CWD=/home/user/Documents`

``` Bash
function yo()
{
	echo "yo"
}
```

+ To view environment variable: `env`.
+ To view the value of a single variable: `echo + <variable name>`.

+ To remove a variable or custombash function: `unset -f + <function>`.

``` Bash
function yo (){
	echo "yo"
}
yo
yo
unset
yo
command not found
```

+ To display shell options and their current settings: `shopt`
+ To create a new variable: `export <Variable name> = <function name>`
+ To determine if something is a function, file. alisas, bulit-in or keyword: `type <word>`

```BASH
echo "$PATH" => variable environment. Weak quotes
echo '$PATH' => print '$PATH' -- Strong quotes
```

+ To show the full path to a function: `which ls` or `type -P ls`
