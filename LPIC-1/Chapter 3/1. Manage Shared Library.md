#### What is a shared library?
+ Files containing functionality that other applications can use
+ These files end in a `.so` extension - short for `shared object`.
+ `/lib`, `/usr/lib` (for 32bit) and `/usr/lib64` (for 64bit), `/usr/local/lib`, `/usr/share` are the location that library can be found

>[!info] There are 2 types of library files:
>+ `Dynamic`: ends in `.so`.
>+ `Statically linked`: ends in `.a`


>[!info] Why are there multiple folders for libraries
>`/lib`: This directory contains essential libraries required for the system to boot and operate properly. It includes critical shared libraries that are needed during the early stages of the boot process, such as those used by the kernel and basic system utilities.
>
>`/usr/lib`: This directory stores libraries that are not essential for the system's basic operation but are still necessary for most user applications. It contains shared libraries that are used by programs installed on the system.
>
>`/usr/local/lib`: This directory is used to store libraries that are specific to locally installed software. When you manually compile and install software from source code (rather than using a package manager), the libraries associated with that software are typically installed in this directory to keep them separate from system-wide libraries. It helps to avoid conflicts with libraries managed by the package manager.
>
>`/usr/share`: This directory contains architecture-independent data files, including documentation, icons, fonts, and other non-executable files shared across different systems. It may also include some architecture-dependent files used by applications.

>[!info] `Dynamic library` and `static library`
>**`Dynamic Library`**, also known as a shared library, is a file containing compiled code and data that can be used by multiple programs simultaneously:
>+ Dynamic libraries are designed to be loaded into memory and linked at runtime by programs that require their functionality.
>+ Dynamic libraries have file extensions like .so (on Linux), .dll (on Windows), or .dylib (on macOS).
>+ Multiple programs can use the same shared library file, reducing disk space and memory consumption.
>+ Dynamic libraries can be updated independently without requiring recompilation or relinking of the programs using them.
>
>**`Static Library`** is a file containing compiled code and data that is directly linked into an executable file at compile time:
>+ When a program is statically linked with a library, a copy of the library code is embedded directly into the resulting executable file.
>+ Static libraries have file extensions like .a (on Linux and macOS) or .lib (on Windows).
>+ Each program that uses a static library has its own copy of the library code, resulting in larger executable sizes.
>+ Statically linked programs do not rely on external library files during runtime, making them more self-contained and independent.

>[!info] `Execute at runtime` and `Execute at complie time`
>**`Execute at runtime`** refers to the execution of code or actions that occur during the actual runtime of a program. At runtime, the program **is running** and performing its intended operations, and certain actions can be **performed dynamically** based on specific conditions or user input.
>
>**`Execute at compile time`** refers to actions or code that are executed **during the compilation process of a program**, before the resulting executable is generated. **During compilation**, the source code of a program is translated into machine code or bytecode that the computer can understand and execute.

#### Managing Shared Library

`ldd` + `path (/bin/su)`: Short for List Dynamic Dependencies, which is used to display the shared object dependencies of an executable or shared library files.

`ldconfig`: Linker/Loader configuration, which is used to update the cache of shared library locations and symbolic links, allowing the system to locate and load shared libraries during program execution.

`/etc/ld.so.conf`: is a configuration file used by the dynamic linker (ld.so) to determine the directories to search for shared libraries.

>[!info] These command are helpful as it is crucial for installing application:
>When installing a separate appication that comes with its own library:
>+ `Install the application`: Simply following the install instruction.
>+ `Identify the library dependency`: Determine which shared libraries are required by the application.
>+ `Install the library dependencies`: Check if the requried libraries are already installed on the system. If not install them.
>+ `Update the dynamic linker cache`: run `ldconfig` to update dynamic linker cache.
>+ `Verify the library installation`: confirm that the libraries are installed by checking their presence in the standard library directories in `/etc/ld.so.conf` or simply use `ldd` on the application.
