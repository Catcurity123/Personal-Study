### What is a pseudo file system
+ A regular file system is a method of laying out files and folders on a physical hard disk
+ A pseudo file system does not exsit on a physical hard disk. `Pseudo` means *fake* or *not real*. It is actually created by the `Linux kernel` after the computer boots up and it only exist in `RAM` during run time.
+ Most noticable `/proc` and `/sys`

### `/proc` 
+ Contains information about the processes running on a system. 
+ Processes are listed by `PID` with hardware and process data both in the same directory structure.
>[!info]+ Some noteworthy file in `/proc`
>+ `cpuinfo`: Information about the CPU
>+ `meminfo`: Information about the Memory
>+ `partition`: Information about the partitions
>+ `uptime`: Information about how long the CPU has run
>+ `version`: Information about the version of Linux
