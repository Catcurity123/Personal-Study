### What happens when a Linux system boots

1. After starting the computer, the `BIOS` on the motherboard, check all hardware input and output devices
2. After checking out, the `GRUB` (Grand Unified Bootloader) on `Master Boot Record` (MBR) on the first sector of the bootable disk, look for the section of the hard drive that contains the data needed to boot an OS.
3. The bootloader will then load the `Linux Kernel`, then the Kernel will load the `initial RAM Disk`, which contains a bunch of device drivers and starts to load the computer's drivers.
4. After the Kernel is all set up, it will start the `initialization system`, the computer's drivers will then be handed to this system for later initialization, at this point the `initial RAM Disk` is no longer needed and get removed.

### Boot logs

This is the logs that are generated when the computer itself boots up, these logs are `volatile` meaning that they will be discarded once the computer reset. These logs are generated from an area called `Kernel Ring Buffer`, which is an area of `RAM` that the Kernel writes all of its system messages to.

`dmesg`: Short form *Display message*, it is the traditional utility used for viewing the `Kernel Ring Buffer`.

`journalctl -k`: Short for *Journal Control*, it is an utility used to view the `Kernel Ring Buffer` within the `systemd` journal.


### /init

+ `init` - Short for *initialization*, is a service based off of the System V used in UNIX systems.

>[!info]+ `init` startup process:
>After the `Linux Kernel` starts up and brings in the initial RAM disk. it then seek out an initialization system to hand over control of the computer (`/sbin/init`).
>After handling over, `int` will seek out to `/etc/inittab` to further configuring the computer. Specifically, it will check the `runlevel` for the system

##### `inittab`
![[inittab.png]]

##### `runlevel`

+ `runlevel 0`: **halt** or **shutdown**, this is when `init` run scripts that stop services and power off the system.
+ `runlevel 1`: Single user Mode, this is usually used for maintenance task and repair functionality.
+ `runlevel 2`: Multi-user mode, without networking.
+ `runlevel 3`: Multi-user mode, with networking - this is the default configuration for Linux system without graphical desktop.
+ `runlevel 4`: This is not usually used, but can be available should the administrator want to configure a user-made runlevel.
+ `runlevel 5`: Multi-user mode, with networking and graphical desktop - this is usually the default configuration for Linux system with graphical desktop
+ `runlevel 6`: Reboot runlevel, where init stop services and reboot the system!

![[runlevel.png]]

**Example**
``` bash
id:3:initdefault: #<identifier>:<runlevel>:<action>:<process>
#As this is the default action, there is no need for process
si::sysinit:/etc/rc.d/rc.sysinit
# <identifier>: si (short for Sys Init)
# <runlevel>: null
# <action>: sysinit
# <process>: rc.d/rc.sysinit

#=> sysinit means that this action takes place when the system first start up, hence, there is no need for a runlevel. This script means that when the computer starts up, the script in the process will be ran for initialization.
```

With this we can summarize our boot process as follows:
>[!info]+ Boot Process:
>1. Power on the computer.
>2. The computer either uses BIOS or EUFI as firmware to boot the system.
>3. The firmware read information in the boot device (either the USB or hard drive).
>4. The bootloader then start (usually GRUB - Grand Unified Bootloader) to load kernel modules.
>5. After finished loading, the Kernel hand over the control of the machine to `init` in `/sbin/init`.
>6. The `init` process then seek information and action in `/etc/inittab` such as runlevel and start up scripts.
>7. After executing all the scripts, the system is now ready to use.

>[!info]+ What scripts does init use to initialize the system?
>The traditional location for these scripts are:
>+ `Red Hat Based: /etc/rc.d`
>+ `Debian Based: /etc/init.d`
>In these location, containing scripts for the initialization process, `rc1.d` is for `runlevel`, `rc.sysinit` does house cleaning process before we enter the init process, `rc.local` is usally the file for administrator to use to customize additional process.

* In these folders are the scripts for each `runlevel` to be used for initialization.

##### `upstart`

+ First developed for Ubuntu in 2006, first used in Ubuntu 6.1.0, and eventually used in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6, Debian and Fedora 9.
+ Unlike `init`, `upstart` offers asynchronous starting of services => decreasing boot up times.
+ Works off real-timee events, which init was not designed to understand, `upstart` does not only stop and start service, but monitor them as well.

##### `systemd`

+ `init` amd part of `upstart` rely on Bash shell scripts
+ `Systemd` replace the functionality of the shell scripts with compiled C code.
+ Still compatible with older System V `init` script

##### `Unit File Location`

**Unit File** is a configuration file used by the `systemd init` system. It defines how a specific unit should be managed by `systemd`. A unit can represent various system resources such as services, devices, mount points, sockets,...

**Unit file** can be grouped into the following main functionalities and roles:
+ **System Services**: unit files that manage essential system services. `sshd.service (SSH server)`, `network.service (networking)`, `httpd.service (web server)`, `cron.service (cron daemon)`, `systemd-logind.service (user session management)`, `dbus.service (D-Bus system message bus)`.
+ **Device Management**: unit files related to device management and configuration. `udev.service (device manager)`, `bluetooth.service (Bluetooth subsystem)`, `cups.service (printing subsystem)`, `alsa-restore.service (state restoration)`
**search group unit file into functionality and roles group**


+ To view user-specific units: `/usr/lib/systemd/system`
+ To view system-level units: `/etc/systemd/system`.
+ Runtime unit files: `/run/systemd/system`
+ View all unit files on a system: `systemctl list-unit-file`

**Components of the Unit File**
+ Unit files follow the INI style format first seen in MS-DOS.

```Bash
[Unit]
Description=Multi-User System
Documentation=man:systemd.special(7)
Requres=basic.target #this can be Wants=(more robust)
Conflicts=rescue.service rescue.target
After=basic.target rescue.service rescue.target
```

=> `Systemd` is the New `Init`

#### Some other useful comment regarding to this topic

`ps`: short for `process status`, this command will retrieve details such as process IDs (PIDs), CPU and memory usage that are currently running.

![[ps.png]]
<figcaption style="text-align: center;font-weight: bold;">Process status</figcaption>
+ `-p`: specifies the PID of the process we wish to retrieve
+ `-o comm=`: specifies the customized output format.
