`udev`: short for *Unix Device*, this is a device manager service that manages devices attached to Linux machine.

`/dev`: short for *device*, is a pseudo file system that contains the actual handles to all devices that are connected to the system.

`D-Bus`: is a message bus system in Linux and other Unix-like OS, `udev` utilize `dbus` to notify user and the system when new hardware is attached.

`lspci`: short fo *List Peripheral Component Interconnect*, is a command used to display information about PCI devices attached.
+ `-k`: details on each PCI devices.
+ `-v`: even more details on each PCI. devices.

- `-t`: list USB as a tree

>[!info]+ What is a `block` storage and what is a `byte-level` storage?
>In computing, a block is a **fixed-sized unit of data that is used for efficient storage and retrieval**. From users' perspective, storage devices such as USB drives and hard disks appear to be divided into discrete unit of bytes. However, internally, these devices use blocks to sore and retrieve data. 
>
>For example, `FAT32` file system used by many USB drives and SD cards typically use a cluster size of `4KB`. This means that if we have a file of `10KB`, we will need `3 blocks` to store them and pad the remaining `2KB`.
>
>`Byte-level storage`, on the other hand, allows data to be **read and written at the byte level**. This approach is commonly used in **memory devices such as RAM**, where data can be accessed and manipulated at the byte level.
