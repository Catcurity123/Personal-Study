### What is Linux Kernel
+ The core framework of the OS.
+ Provides a way for the rest of the system to operate with hardware, memory, networking, and itself.
+ Linux kernel is monolithic, meaning:
		1. The kernel handles all **memory management and hardware device interactions.**
		2. Extra functionality can be **loaded and unloaded dynamically through kernel modules**.
		3. Ensures that the system will **not need to be rebooted into a different kernel image for added functionality**.
+ Many third-party `Linux kernel modules` are device drivers.

+ 6 main tasks of a kernel: **Process Management**, **Memory Management**, **Device Management**, **File System Management**, **Networking**, **System Calls**.
