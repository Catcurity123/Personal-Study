#### G. S3 Encryption
(+) Bucket are not encrypted only objects are encrypted
(+) There are `client-side encryption` and `server-side encryption`. Both of them are encryption at rest.

(+) `Client-side encryption` refers to the practice of the client encrypted the data before uploading onto storage medium (S3 in this case), after uploading onto S3, the data will be encrypted again by AWS and stored on physical S3 storage. During this whole process, AWS can not make sense of any of the uploaded data as it is encrypted the whole time.
(+) `Server-side encryption` refers to the practice of client upload the unencrypted data onto storage medium (S3 in this case), after uploading onto S3, the data will be encrypted by AWS and stored onphysical S3 storage. Although the data will be encrypted and protected during transmission, it is still visable at S3 endpoint.

(+) There are 3 types of `server-side encryption`: `Server-side Encryption with Customer-Provided Keys (SSE-C)`, `Server-Side Encryption with Amazon S3-Managed Keys (SSE-S3)`, and `Server-Side Encrytion with Customer Master Keys (CKMs) Stored in AWS Key Management Service (SSE-KMS)`

(+) With `SSE-C`: The customer is responsible for `encryption keys` and AWS responsible for the `encryption and decryption process`. In this case, we are offloading the encryption process (which take computing power) to S3, but we still need to handle the creation and management of `encrypted keys.`

(+) With `SSE-S3 (AES256)`: With this method, S3 manages both the creation and management of keys as well as the encryption and decryption process of the data.
The user only needs to provide S3 with the data. With this method, S3 creates a master key and create for the encryption and decryption process, the user has no influence over this and it is done behind the scene.
(+) This is the standard method of encryption on S3, but it has 3 major drawbacks:
	(-) This is not suitable for regulatory environment where we need to `control access to keys`
	(-) This is not suitable when we need to control the `rotation of keys` according to business logic.
	(-) This is not suitable when we need to define `role-separtion`, as the S3 admin can view the key, and use the key to encrypt or decrypt the data. This is not suitatble as business logic define the `administrative grou`p (which control the system) and `functional group` (which use the system), most of the case the `administrative group` can not perform actions provided for `functional group`.

(+) With `SSE-KMS`: In this case, AWS also handles the creation, management and encryption-decryption process of the data. However, while `SSE-S3` handle encrytion process underline, in this situation we will create a CMK on KMS which will be used to create DEK for every object uploaded on S3. Meaning that whenever we upload data onto S3, S3 will be provided with a DEK created by CMK (created by us) to encrypt the data. Therefore, we can control the management of the CMK (the permission of it using key policies), the key rotation and subsequently achieve role-separation because when we want to decrypt the data using `SSE-KMS` we need to have access to the created CMK.

(+) `Bucket Default Encryption`: If set, objects will use the default encryption if we dont explicitly specifies the encryption we wanted.
