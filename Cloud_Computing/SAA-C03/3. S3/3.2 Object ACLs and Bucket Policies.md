#### 1. S3 Bucket Policies
(+) Bucket Policy works on an  `entire bucket` level.
(+) S3 Bucket policies is a form of `resource policy`, just like `identity policy`. The main difference is that `resource policy` is assigned to a `resource`, while `identity policy` is assigned to an `identity`.
(+) This provide a `resource perspective permission`, meaning we are controlling `who can access this resource`, while with `identity policy` we are controlling what can that identity access.
(+) Bucket policy can `Allow/Deny` `anonymous` principals, which can't be done using `identity policy`.

###### Note
(+) `Identity policy` has one significant limitation, it can only be attached to identity inside our account, meaning that it can only provide security in our own account.
	==> For example if we want to assign a permission for an entity outside of our account, we must log into the account that controls that entity, there is no way to do it in our account.

(+) `Resource policy`, however, `ALLOW/DENY` same or different accounts, overcoming the limitation of `identity policy`. This is a great way to control the access to a resource no matter the source of access.

###### Example
(+) Another main difference between `Resource policy` and `Identity policy`  is the exisistence of `Principal` field in the policy. For `Identity Policy` it is understood that the `Principal` is the creating account itself, however,  for `Resource policy` we must explicitly provide the `Principal` who can access the resource.

(+) There can only be 1 bucket policy applied to the bucket, but the policy can have multiple statements.

#### 2. Access Control Lists (ACLs)
(+) ACLs work on `object-level`.
(+) ACLs on objects and bucket, it is a subresource and is legacy.
(+) The reason is because it is inflexible and simple permission.

#### 3. Block Public Access
(+) This setting is only applied to `public and anonymous principals`. It provide an extra, outter layer of protection for S3 bucket. `Bucket policy`, however, is the inner protection of S3 bucket

(+) `Option 1`: Enable all the other options
(+) `Option 2`: Block public access to newly added buckets or objects and prevent the creation of new ACLs for existing buckets and objects. However, this setting does not change existing permissions that allows public access to S3 using ACLs.
(+) `Option 3`: Block public access to all buckets and objects no matter it is newly created or existing.
(+) `Option 4`: Block public access to newly added buckets or objects. However, this setting does not change existing permissions that allows public access to S3 through policies.
(+) `Option 5`: Block public access and cross-account access to buckets and objects no matter it is newly created or existing.

### Summary 
(+) `Identity Policy` is a good method when we need to control different resources through one centralized platform on one account.
(+) `Bucket Policy or Resource Policy` is a good method when we need to control access right to one product or access can be through anonymous and cross-account principals.
(+) `Buckets are private by default`: When you create an S3 bucket, it is private by default(including all objects within it). You have to allow public access on both the bucket and its object in order to make the bucket public
(+) `Object ACLs`: You can make `indibidual objects` public using object ACLs.
(+) `Bucket policies`: YOu can make `entire buckets` public using bucket policies
(+) `HTTP status code`: when you upload an object to S3 and its successful, you will receive an HTTP 200 code.
