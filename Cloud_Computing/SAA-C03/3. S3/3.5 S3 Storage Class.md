#### S3 Storage Classes
###### 1. S3 Standard
![[Pasted image 20240104135116.png | 600]]
(+) Objects are replicated accross `at least 3 AZs` in the AWS region
(+) Billed a `GB/m fee` for `data stored`. A `$ per GB` for transfer `OUT` (In is free) and a price `per 1,000 requests`.
(+) Suitable for `Frequently Accessed` data which is `important and non replaceable`.

###### 2. S3 Standard-IA (Infrequent Access)
![[Pasted image 20240104135716.png | 600]]
(+) Same as Standard but it has a `per GB data retrieval fee` meaning frequent data access will increase the cost. It also has a `minimum duration charge of 30 days` and a `minimum capacity charge` of 128KB. Meaning that no matter how short and small your data is and is stored, it will be charged minimum `30 days` and `128KB`, and the bill charged will increase the longer and larger your data is and is stored.
(+) S3 Standard-IA should be used for `long-lived data`, which is `important` but where access is `infrequent`. Dont use it for small data which is stored for a short period and can be easily replaced.

###### 3. S3 One zone-IA
![[Pasted image 20240104140340.png | 600]]
(+) The same as S3 Standard-IA but does not have replication on multiple AZs
(+) Suitable for `long-lived data` which is `non-critical` and `replaceable` and where access is `infrequent`.

###### 4. S3 Glacier
![[Pasted image 20240104141012.png | 600]]
(+) In S3 Glacier, Objects is in `chilled state` meaning that it can not be accessed right away, there is a `retrieval process` that need to be done in order to move that objects to Standard-IA temporarily for viewing. The objects can not be made public either.
(+) There is a `40KB min size` and `90 day min duration` bill for objects in this class. 
(+) S3 Glacier is suitable for `archival data` where `frequent or realtime` access `is not needed`. As it is `miniute-hours first byte latency` different from S3 standard which is `milisecond first byte latency`. But it is one of the cheapest form of storage.
(+) Provides `long-term data archiving` with `instant retrieval` time for your data

###### Glacier Flexible Retrieval
(+) Ideal for storage class for archive data that does not require immediate access but needs the flexibility to retrieve large sets of data at no cost, such as back up or disaster recovery use cases. Can be minute or up to 12 hourse

###### 5. S3 Glacier Deep Archive
(+) This class is approximately one-fourth the price of S3 Glacier but with more restriction.
![[Pasted image 20240104141619.png | 600]]
(+) If data in S3 Glacier is in `chilled state` then data in S3 Glacier Deep Archive is in `frozen state` which requires much longer time for retrieval process.
(+) This class is suitable for `archival data` that rarely if ever needs to be accessed - hours of days for retrieval. This is used for legal or regulation data storage of data.

###### 6. S3 Intelligent-Tiering
