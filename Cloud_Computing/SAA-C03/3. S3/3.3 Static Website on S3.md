#### 1. S3 Static Website Hosting
(+) Normal access is via `AWS APIs`, however, this feature allows access via `HTTP` - e.g Blogs,...
(+) `Index` and `Error` documents are set.
(+) `Website Endpoint` is created.
(+) Custom Domain via `R53` ==> In this case `BUCKETNAME MATTERS`, as the bucket name will also be the domain name for the website

###### Offloading and Out-of-band Pages
(+) S3 Static Website Hosting is usually used for Offloading and Out-of-band pages.
(+) `Offloading` refers to the practice of transferring certain processing tasks from the main CPU to specialized hardware or offloading engine. 
	(-) In the context of AWS, a website can be hosted on an EC2 instance where most of the cost and power is carried out to maintain the functionality of the website, we can offload the delivery of media such as video or pictures to S3, effectively reducing the usage of computing resource on EC2 instance.
(+) `Out-of-band Management (OOB)` refers to using a separate resource site which is distinct from primary data network, this is usually used for troubleshooting and maintenance. 
	(-) In the context of AWS, a website hosted on EC2 may be down for maintenance, but we need to display a maintenance pages for user to know. It would not be feasible to host those pages on EC2 instance which is currently down for troubleshooting, therefore, we can host those pages on S3 as an alternative communication path from the main pages.

#### Summary
(+) `Bucket Policies`: Make entire buckets public using bucket policies
(+) `Static content`: Use S3 to host static content only.
(+) `Automatic Scaling`: S3 scales automatically with demand



## Lab Section
###### 1. Host static website using S3, disable ACLs, use Bucket policy to make object and website public.

#### Example of hosting static website
(1) Create bucket, enable it to host static website.
(2) Make it public by untick public block access.
(3) Edit bucket policy
```
{
    "Version": "2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [
        {
            "Sid": "PublicRead",
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Principal": "*",
            "Action": "s3:GetObject",
            "Resource": "arn:aws:s3:::dixluwn-catpics-bucket.org/*"
        }
    ]
}
```

In the above policy, the `Resource filed has ARN which is Amazon Resource Name`. Colons in this field is used to separate different components of the ARN, and their meaning can vary depending on the AWS service and the resource type. The general format is:

```
arn:partition:service:region:account-id:resource
```

So `aws is partition`, `s3 is service`, and as S3 is a global service it does not need region and account id, hence the 3 colons in the ARN follows by the resource id which is `dixluwn-catpics-bucket.org/*`

Other services may have their own arn
