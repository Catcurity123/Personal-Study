###### 1. Object versioning
(+) Object versioning is a setting at `bucket level`, it is `disabled` by default, and once it is `enabled` it can not be set to `disabled` again. It can however be `suspended` and `enabled` again if required.

(+) Versioning lets we store `multiple versions` of objects within a bucket. Operations which would modify the objects `generate a new version`.
	(-) Objects in S3 has an `ID` field, when `object version` is `disabled` this field is `null`. When it is enabled, each objects in the bucket will have an `id`. Operation on this object will create a new version of the object with a different ID while retaining the old object.

(+) Deletion will also affect object versioning, when we delete an object without specifying the version, it will create a `delete marker` which will `HIDE` all the object regarding of its version (not delete just hide). We can delete the `delete marker` to restore the object. But if we delete an object while specifying the version, the next most recent object will be come the current object.

(+) If `Object Versioning` is enable, space is consumed by `ALL` versions, and we will be billed for `ALL` versions. Only way to zero out the cost is to delete the bucket as this setting `CAN NOT BE DISABLED` only suspended, and when suspended all the version is still there.

###### 2. MFA Delete
(+) This is enabled in `versioning configuration`, meaning that MFA is required to change `versioning state`. and MFA is required to `delete versions`.
(+) Serial number (MFA) + Code passed with API CALLs is required.

#### Summary
(+) `All Versions`: All verison of an object are stored in S3. This includes all writes and even if you delete an object
(+) `Backup`: Can be great backup tool
(+) `Cannot be disabled`: Once enabled, versioning cannot be disabled - only suspended.
(+) `Lifecycle rules`: can be integrated with lifecycle rules
(+) `Support MFA`: Can support multi-factor authenticaiton
