#### A. S3 Replication
(+) Replication of S3 allows for `Cross-Region Replication (CRR)` and `Same-Region Replication (SRR)`

(+) Replication configuration is enabled on Source bucket,  a role is needed for S3 to assume so as to perform replication on the destination bucket.
(+) There is one major difference between replication over different account. 
	(-) For replication in the same account, both the source and the destination bucket is owned by the same account, so they both trust account that they are in, they both trust the IAM, and both trust the role. So the role can access both buckets.
	(-) For replication in different account, the destination account is in a different account, so it does not trust the account of the source bucket, meaing that it does not trust the IAM, so it does not trust the role. Meaning the role can not be used to create replication on the destination bucket. To fix this, we need to add a permission in the bucket policy so as to allows the role in the source account to create replication on the destination bucket.

###### S3 Replication Options
(+) We can create replication for all objects or a subset of objects, we can also select the `storage class` for the object.
(+) About the `ownership` of the objects being replicated, the default is that the replicated object is own by the source bucket, meaing that the destination bucket can not view or delete the objects. We can override this so that the ownership is changed to the destination bucket.
(+) `Replication Time Control (RTC)` is to ensure the data between the source and destination is always be in sync.

`NOTE`
(+) Replication is `not retroactive` meaning that the existing data will not be replicated only the newy created.
(+) Replication requires `Versioning to be enabled`.
(+) Replication is `One-way` Source to Destination
(+) Replication support `Unencrypted, SSE-S3, and SSE-KMS`, not `SSE-C` as the keys is not in charge of AWS.
(+) Source bucket needs permission to objects.
(+) Replication do not include system events, objects in Glacier or Glacier Deep Archive.

`Why we use replication`
(+) SRR can be used for log aggregation from different buckets, syncing data from PROD and TEST environment.
(+) SRR might be needed for resilience with strict sovereignty where data must be gathered in one bucket.
(+) CRR can be used for global resilience improvement, or to improve latency reduction for users in different regions.
