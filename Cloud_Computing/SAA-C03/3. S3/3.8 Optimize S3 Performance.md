#### A. S3 Performance Optimization
`Singlle PUT Upload`
(+) The default way of uploading data onto S3 is a `single data stream` from user to s3, meaning that if the stream fails the upload fails and a full restart is required.
(+) The speed and & reliability is limited of 1 streams. This is opposite to downloading data online where it utilizes multiple streams to download and upload data.
(+) Any upload is limited to 5GB.

==> Therefore, distributed transfer of data is being developed to address this issue

(+) There is a solution for this called `Multipart upload`

`Multipart Upload`
(+) Data is broken up, with the min data size of 100MB for multipart. When uploading the maximum parts being broken up is 10,000 max parts, ranging from 5MB -> 5GB.
(+) The last part of `Multipart Upload` can be smaller than 5MB. So parts can fail individually and can be restarted individually.
(+) This means that the transfer rate is equal to the speeds of all parts as they are uploaded individually.

`S3 Byte-Range Fetches`
(+) Parallelize `downloads` by specifying byte ranges.
(+) If there is a failure in the download, its only for a specific byte range.

(+) Used to speed up downloads, and used to download partial amounts of the file (header information)
`S3 Accelerated Transfer (OFF)`

`S3 Accelerated Transfer (ON)`
(+) This feature is switched off by default, the limitation of using this feature is that `the bucket name can not contain period` and `bucket name has to be bucketname-compatible`.
(+) The way this works is that the uploaded data is transfered to the closest `Edge Location` not directly to S3. After that `Edge Location` transfer the data over `AWS Global Network` which is maintained by AWS and tend to be a direct link between the `Edge Location` to other AWS's network.

`NOTE`
(+) It is important to understand that the Internet is a `global, interconnect` network with many stops along the way to enable consistency and redundancy. The Internet is much like a public transport with multiple stops for general public usage.
(+) The `AWS Network` though is purposed-built to link one region to another region in the AWS network. So it is much like an express train, meaning that it is faster and with lower consistent latency.
