#### A. What is Amazon Aurora
(+) A MySQL - and PostgreSQL - compatible relational database engine that combines the speed and availability of high-end commercial atabases with the simplicity and cost-effectiveness of open-sorce databases.

(+) Amazon Aurora provides up to 5 times better performance than MySQL and 3 times better than PostgreSQL databases at a much lower price point, while delivering similar performance and availability.

#### B. Basics about Aurora
(+) Start with 10GB. Scales in 10-GB increments and up to 128 TB (`storage` Auto Scaling)
(+) `Compute resources` can scale up to 96 vCPUs and 768 GB of memory
(+) 2 `copies` of your data are contained in each AZ, with a minimum of 3 AZ. 6 copies of our data
(+) Aurora is designed to transparently handle the `loss of up to 2 copies` of data without affecting databse `write availability` and `up to 3 copies` without affecting `read availability`
(+) `Aurora storage is also self-healing`. Data blocks and disks are continuously scanned for errors and repaired automatically.
