#### A. What is DynamoDB
(+) Fast and flexible NoSQL database service for all applications that need consistent, single-digit milisecond latency at any scale.
(+) Fully managed database and supports both document and key-value data models.
(+) Its flexible data model and reliable performance make it a great fit for low latency application

#### B. DynamoDB Accelerator (DAX)
(+) Fully managed, highly available, in-memory cache
(+) 10x performance improvement
(+) Reduces request time from miliseconds to `microseconds` - even under load.
(+) No need for developers to manage caching logic.
(+) Compatible with DynamoDB API calls.

#### C. On-demand Capacity
(+) `Pay-per-request` pricing
(+) Balance cost and performance, no minimum capacity
(+) `Pay more per request` than with provisioned capacity, use for new product launches.

#### D. Security
(+) Encryption at rest using `KMS`
(+) Site-to-site VPN
(+) Direct Connect (DX)
(+) IAM policies and roles
(+) Fine-grained access
(+) CloudWatch and CloudTrail
(+) VPC endpoints

#### G. Backups data for DynamoDB
(+) `On-demand backup` and restore, full backup at any time, zero impact on table performance or availability
(+) Consistent within seconds and retained until deleted
(+) Operates wotjom same region as source table.

(+) `Point-in-Time recovery` protects against accidental writes or deletes
(+) Restore to any point in the last 35 days
(+) Incremental backups
(+) Not enabled by default
(+) LAtest restorable: 5 minutes in the past.
