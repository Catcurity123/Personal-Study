#### A. What is VPC endpoint (gateway)
(+) Provide `private access` to AWS Public Services without implementing public IP and infrastructure.
(+) Highly Available across all AZs in a region by default
(+) Endpoint policy is used to control what it can access.
(+) Regional `cant access cross-region` services
(+) `Prevent Leaky buckets` - S3 Bucket can be set to private only by allowing access only from a gateway endpoint

==> The above picture presents why gateway is important, to access S3, resources inside VPC needs IP (whether from public instance or via NATGW for private instance) making it not optimal for security-focused infrastructure.

#### B. What is VPC endpoint (Interface)
(+) Provide private access to AWS Public Service, anything `NOT S3 and DDB`
(+) Added to specific subnets - an ENI => `not HA`
(+) For HA, add one endpoint, to one subnet, per AZ used in the VPC

#### C. VPC Peering
(+) Direct encrypted network link between two VPCs
(+) Works same/cross-region and same/cross-account
(+) Public Hostnames resolves to private IPs
