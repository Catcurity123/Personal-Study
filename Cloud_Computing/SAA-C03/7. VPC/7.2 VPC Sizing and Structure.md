#### A. VPC Sizing and Structure 
###### 1.  IP ranges to avoid
(+) `192.168.10.0/24` (192.168.10.0 -> 192.168.10.255)
(+) `10.0.0.0/16` (AWS) (10.0.0.0 -> 10.0.255.255)
(+) `172.31.0.0/16` (Azure) (172.31.0.0 -> 172.31.255.255.255)
(+) `10.128.0.0/9` (Google) (10.128.0.0 -> 10.255.255.255)

###### 2. IP Considerations
(+) VPC minimum `/28` (16 IPs), maximum `/16` (65456), and the first four and the last IPs is reserved by AWS.
(+) Personal preference for `10.x.y.z` range
(+) `Avoid common ranges` - avoid future issues.

==> When thinking about how many IPs should be allocated, think about how many regions AWS will operates in, after that add a buffer to protect from growth.

`NOTE`
(+) The 5 reserved IPs are as follows:
	(-) Network Addresss (10.16.0.0)
	(-) VPC Router (10.16.0.1)
	(-) DNS IPs (10.16.0.2)
	(-) Reserved for future use (10.16.0.3)
	(-) Broadcast Address (10.16.16.255)

###### 3. VPC Structure
(+) Minimum of 4 AZs (3 for minimum, one for buffer), and 4 tiers (Web, App, DB, and one buffer)

###### 4. Custom VPCs
(+) Regional Service - All AZs in the region, Isolated network, nothing `in` or `out` without explicit configuration. The minimum private IPv4 CIDR Block is `/28` and maximum `/16`.
(+) Has the option to chose `default` or `dedicated tenancy`. If VPCs is in `dedicated tenancy`, all resources in the VPCs will be in `dedicated tenancy`.

###### 5. DNS in VPC
(+) Provided by R53, this is one of the reserved IPs in the 5 reserved IPs of VPC's subnet. The address is `Base IP + 2`.
(+) There is an option to `enableDnsHostnames` to give instances DNS Names and `enableDnsSupport` to enables DNS resolution in VPC.

###### 6. VPC Subnets
(+) `AZ resilient`, A subnetwork of a VPC - `within a particular AZ`.
(+) A subnet is in 1 AZ, 1 AZ may have one or more Subnet (or none).
(+) IPv4 CIDR is a subset of the VPC CIDR, and cannot overlap with other subnets.
(+) Subnets can communicate with other subnets in the VPC.
(+) DHCP Option Set can be created but can not be editted.
