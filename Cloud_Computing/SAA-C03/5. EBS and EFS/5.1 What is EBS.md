#### A. Storage refresher
###### 1. Storage Terms
(+) `Direct (local) attached Storage` - Storage on the EC2 Host, it is fast but if the disk, or hardware fails, the disk is lost and if the EC2 instance moves to a different host, the disk is lost. As this storage option is directly attached to the EC2 instance.
(+) `Network Attached Storage` - Volumes delivered over the network (EBS), which is highly resilient and is separated from the EC2 instance (but in the same AZ).
(+) `Ephemeral Storage` - Temporary storage
(+) `Persistent Storage` - Permanently storage - lives on past the lifetime of the instance.
(+) `Block Storage` - volume presented to the `OS` as a collection of blocks, no structure provvided. `Mountable` and `Bootable`. The thing about `Block Storage` is that is has no structure provided, just a collection of uniquely identified blocks, the addressing and structure of data is done by the OS via filesystem.
(+) `File Storage` - Presented as a file share has structure, `mountable` `not bootable`.
(+) `Object Storage` - collection of objects, flat. `Not mountable` and `Not bootable`.

###### 2. Storage Performance

(+) `IO or block size`: the block size specifies the amount of data transferred at once between the volume and the instance attached to it. EBS supports 4 different block sizes: 1KiB, 4KiB, 8KiB, and 32 KiB.
(+) `Input/Output Operation Per Second (IOPS)`: refers to the number of read/wrtie requests a particular storage device can handle concurrently.
(+) `Throughput`: While `IOPS` determine how quickly individual operations occur, throughput describes the total rate at which data moves across the storage interface.

#### B. Volumes and Snapshots
###### 1. Volumes
(+) Volumes are simply virtual hard disks. You need a minimum of 1 volume per EC2 instance. This is acalled the `root device volume`.

###### 2. Snapshots
(+) Snapshots `exist on S3`, think of snapshots as a photograph of the virtual disk/volume.
(+) Snapshot s are point in time, when you take a snapshot, it is a `point-in-time copy of a volume`.
(+) Snapshots are `incremental`, this means only the `data that has been changed since your last snapshots` are moved to S3. This saves dramatically on space and the time it takes to take a snapshot
(+) The first snapshot may take some `time` to create as there is `no previous point-in-time` copy

###### 2.1 Tips for snapshots
(+) Snapshots capture data that has been written to EBS volume, which may `exclude any data that has been locally cached` by application or OS. It is recommended that we `stop the instance` and then take a snap.
(+) Encrypted snapshots will be taken automatically if the EBS is encrypted
(+) We can only share the snapshot in the region which they were created, to share to another region, we must copy them to the destination first.

#### C. What to know about EBS volumes
(+) `Location`: EBS volumes will always be in the same AZ as EC2 in which it is attached.

(+) `Resizing`: EBS volumes can be resized on the fly, no need to stop or restart. However, we will need to exten filesystem in the OS so the OS can see the resized volume

(+) `Volume Type`: Volume types can be changed on the fly (e.g., go from gp2 to io2). We do not need to stop or restart the instance.

(+) We can take a snapshot of an EBS volume, copy it to another region, and then create an AMI from that snapshot and redeploy our instances on a different region.
