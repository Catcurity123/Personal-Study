#### A. EBS Encryption
(+) EBS encrypts volume with a data key using the industry standard AES-256 algorithm. AMazon EBS encryption uses AWS KMS Customer master key (CMK) when creating encrypted volumes and snapshots.

#### B. What happens when you encrypt an EBS volume
(+) Data at rest is encrypted inside the volume.
(+) All data in flight moving between the instance and the volume is encrypted.
(+) All snapshots are encrypted.
(+) All volumes created from the snapshot are encrypted.

#### C. EBS encryption
(+) Handled transparrently, has minal latency.
(+) Copying an unencrypted snapshots allows encryption.
(+) Snapshots of encrypted volumes are encrypted.
(+) Encrypt root device volumes upon creation.

#### D. Steps to encrypt an unencrypted volume
(+) Create a snapshot of the unencrypted root device volume
(+) Create a copy of the snapshot and select the encrypt option
(+) Create an AMI from the encrypted snapshot
(+) Use that AMI to launch new encrypted instances.
