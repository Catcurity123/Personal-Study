#### A. EBS Behaviors Reviewed
(+) When we stop and terminate an EC2 instance, the data is kept on the disk (with EBS) and will r`emain on the disk until the EC2 instance is started`. If the instance is `terminated`, then the `default root device volume will also be terminated`.

#### B. What is EC2 hibernation
(+) When we hibernate an EC2 instance, the OS is told to perform hibernation (suspend-to-disk). Hibernation `saves the content` from the instance memory (`RAM`) to Amazon `EBS` root volume.

`When we start your instance out of hibernation:`
(+) The Amazon EBS root volume is restored to its previous state.
(+) The RAM content are reloaded.
(+) The process that were previously running on the instance are resumed.
(+) Previously attached data volumes are reattached and the instance retains its instance ID.

==> With EC2 hibernation, the instance boots much faster. The OS does not need to reboot because the in-memory state (RAM) is preserved. This is useful for `Long-running processes`, `service that need times`.
