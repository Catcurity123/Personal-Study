#### A. What is an AMI
(+) AMI provides the information required to launch an instance
(+) 5 things we can base our AMI on: Region, OS, Architecture (32 or 64 bit), Launch Permission, Storage for the root device.

(+) All AMIs are categorized as either backed by:
	(-) Amazon EBS: The root device for an instance launched from the AMI is an Amazon EBS volume created from an `Amazon EBS snapshot`.
	(-) Instance Store: The root device for an instance launched from AMI is an instance store volume created from a template `stored in Amazon S3`.

#### B. Instance Store Volumes
(+) Instnace store volumes are sometimes called `ephermeral storage`. Instnace store volumes cannot be stopped. If the underlyign host fails, you will lose your data. Rebooting does not lose the data, when we delete the instance the data will be lost
