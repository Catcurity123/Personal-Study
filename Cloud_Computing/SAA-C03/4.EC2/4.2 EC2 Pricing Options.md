#### A. Instance Pricing Models
(+) `On-Demand Instances:` Instances have an hourly rate, billed in `seconds` (60s minimum) or `Hourly` , no long-term commitments or upfront payments. Good for new or uncertain application requirements or `short-term`, `spiky`, `unpredictable` workloads which `can't tolerate any disruption`.

(+) `Spot Instance`: Spot pricing offers up to 90% off vs On-Demand. A spot price is set by EC2 - based on `spare capacity`. You can sprcify a `maximum price`, if spot price goes above yours `instance terminated`, therefore, it is only used for apps which `can tolerate failure`.

(+) `Reserved Instances`: up to 75% off vs On-demand - `for a commitment`. Buy 1 or 3 years in advance (all upfront, partial upfront, no upfront). `Reserved in region`, or AZ with capacity reservation. Good for `Known stady state usage`, low cost for apps which `cant handle disruption`.
