#### A. Different Pricing Models for EC2
(+) `On-demand`: Pay by the hour or the second, depending on the type of instance
(+) `Reserved`: Reserved capacity for 1 or 3 years. Up to 72% discount on the hourly charge.
(+) `Spot`: Purchase unused capacity at a discount up to 90%, Prices fluctuate with supply and demand
(+) `Dedicated`: A physical EC2 server dedicated for your use. The most expensive option.

#### B. Where to use spot instance
(+) Stateless, fault-tolerant, or flexible applications. Application such as big data, containerized workloads, CI/CD, and other test and development workloads.

(+) To use Spor Instance, we must first decide on the maximum spot price, The instance will be provisioned so long as the spot price is `Below` you maximum spot price.

#### C. Spot Fleets
(+) SPot Fleets try and match the target capacity with your price restraints
(+) Set up different launch pools, define EC2 instance type, OS, AZ. We can have multiple pools, and the fleet will choose the best way to implement depending on the strategy defined.
(+) Spot fleets will stop launching instance once we reach the price threshold or capacity desires
