#### B. EC2 Instance Type
(+) EC2 Instance Type affects raw CPU, Memory, Local Storage Capacity & Type.
(+) `Resource Ratios` and `Storage` and `Data` network `bandwidth`.
(+) System Architecture/ Vendor, and additional features and capabilities.

###### 1. EC2 Categories
(+) `General Purpose` - Default - Diverse workloads, equal resource ratio.
(+) `Compute Optimized` - Media Processing, HPC, Scientific Modelling, gaming, ML.
(+) `Memory Optimized` - Processing large in-memory datasets, sone database workloads.
(+) `Accelerated Computing` - Hardware GPU, field programmable gate arrays (FPGAs).
(+) `Storage Optimized` - Sequential and random IO - sacle-out transactional databases, data warehousing, Elasticsearch, analytic workloads.

###### 2. Decoding EC2 Types

#### C. EC2 Instance Roles
![[Pasted image 20240130144613.png]]

(+) Credentials are inside meta-data => `iam/security-credentials/role-name`
(+) Automatically rotated - always valid
(+) Should always be used rather than adding access keys into instances

#### D. EC2 Optimization
###### 1. Enhance networking
(+) Uses `SR-IOV` - NIC is virtualization aware
![[Pasted image 20240201150510.png]]
(+) No charge - available on most EC2 Types, with `Higher I/O, Lower Host CPU Usage` with more `Bandwidth`
(+) Higher packets-per-second (`PPS`), consistent lower `latency`.


###### 2. EBS Optimized
(+) `EBS` = block storage over the network.
(+) Historically network was `shared` .. `data` and `EBS`.
(+) EBS optimized means dedicated capacity for EBS.
(+) Most instances `support` and have `enabled by default`. Some support, but enabling costs extra.
