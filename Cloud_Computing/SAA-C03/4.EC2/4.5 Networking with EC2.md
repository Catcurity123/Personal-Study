#### A. EC2 Architecture
(+) EC2 host has local hardware such as CPU and memory and local storage called `instance store`, if `instances` move to different host this storage will be lost.
(+) When an `instance` is provisioned into a `subnet` within a `vpc`, a primary elastic interface is provisioned in that subnet that maps to the physical hardware on the EC2 host.
(+) EC2 can connect to remote storage called Elastic Block Store or EBS. EBS allows us to allocate volume which can be then allocated to EC2.
(+) Remember that EC2, Subnets, Network, and persistent stoarage are in an `Availability Zone`.
(+) Instances can have multiple interfaces even in different subnets, as long as they are in the same AZ.

`What is EC2 good for`
(+) Traditional `OS+Applciation` compute, for `long-running` compute.
(+) `Server` style application either `burst` or `steady-state load`.
(+) `Monolithic` application stacks
(+) `Migrated` application workloads or `disaster recovery`.

#### B. EC2 Networking
(+) We can attach 3 different types of `virtual networking cards` to our EC2 instances.
(+) `Elastic Network Interface (ENI)`: For basic, day-to-day, networking.

(+) `Enhanced Networking (EN)`: Uses single root I/O virtualization (SR-IOV) to provide high performance
