#### A. Network Access Control Lits (NACLs)
(+) `NACL` can be though of as the `firewall` that surronds `Subnets` in a VPC, therefore, connection from resources in a subnet travelling to another subnet will go through NACL, but resources within a subnet when communicating will not go through NACL.

(+) By default, NACL is designed to allows everything both inbound and outbound.
(+) When a client making a connection to an instance with NACL applied, let's say client is making HTTPS request, meaning using `TCP/443`. From the instance's perspective, the inbound rule is TCP/443, but when the instance want to respond to the client, it will choose a random `ephemeral port` to transmit the data. Therefore, we need to implement a rule for this transmission.

(+) Things will get even more complicated if the web server is just an interface an it will need to connect with the application in another subnet, if that's the case, we will need to implement outbound and inbound rule for this connection in both the web's NACL and the app's NACL.
==> Therefore, to ease things up, NACL is by default allows everything on both ends.

`Note`
(+) When Bob is making a request, he is conducting the `Initiation` process, and when the web instance's connect with Bob it is conducting the `Response` process, these processes are 2 different streams of connection with 2 different rules. The instance makes no sense of the 2 streams and need to applied 2 different NACLs to them ==> Therefore, NACL is `stateless`, meaning it can not make sense of the connection stream.
(+) NACL only impacts data `crossing subnet border`, meaning it will only affects data coming from and to intances on different subnet.
(+) NACL can `explicitly allow and deny`.
(+) IPs/Networks, Port and Protocols are supported, not logical resources.
(+) NACLs cannot be assigned to AWS resources, only subnets.
(+) Use with SG's to add explicit Deny (Bad IPs/Nets)
(+) One subnet can only be assigned with one NACL at a time.
(+) Process in order from the lowest to the alterisk, ==> NACL is `order processing`.

#### B. Security Groups (SG)
(+) EC2 has one or more virtual network interface card (vNIC) attached to it, and data sent from and to EC2 will go through this vNIC, and `SG` is assigned to AWS resource, specifically the network interface.
(+) `SG` is `stateful`, meaning that `SG` remember the characteristic of the incoming connection, and when the outcoming connection matches it, it will automatically allows the outbound connection. This will mean that only one rule is needed for conenction, in the contrary to `NACL`.
(+) `SG` understands AWS's resources, therefore, not relying entirely on IPs or Networks. Meaning that we can refer AWS resources instead of its IPs.
(+) `SG` has an `hidden implicit deny` meaning that rules that are not `explicitly allows` will be understood as `denied` and 1 `SG` does not have `explicit deny`.

`Note`:
(+) `SG` is `Stateful`, meaning that SG sees `Initiation and Response` are the same thing.
(+) `SG` can filter based on `AWS Logical resources`
(+) `SG` has hidden implicit deny and explicit allows but dont have `explicit deny`
(+) `NACLs` is used on subnet for an products which dont work with SG's `(NAT Gateway)`
(+) NACLs is used when adding explicit Deny (Bad IPs, bad actors).
(+) SG is used as the default `almost everywhere`

#### C. Bootstrapping
(+) A script that runs when the instance first runs

(+) Sample Bootstrap script.
```
#!/bin/bash
yum update -y
yum install httpd -y
systemctl start httpd
systemctl enable httpd
cd /var/www/html
echo "<html><body><h1>Hello Cloud Gurus</h1></body></html>" > index.html
```
