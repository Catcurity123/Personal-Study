(+) EC2 instances are `virtual machines` (OS + Resource), EC2 Instance run EC2 hosts.
(+) Hosts can be `shared hosts` or `dedicated hosts`. 
(+) EC2 is `AZ resilient` as the Host runs in a single AZ, so host fails means instances falls.

#### A. EC2 Architecture
(+) EC2 host has local hardware such as CPU and memory and local storage called `instance store`, if `instances` move to different host this storage will be lost.
(+) When an `instance` is provisioned into a `subnet` within a `vpc`, a primary elastic interface is provisioned in that subnet that maps to the physical hardware on the EC2 host.
(+) EC2 can connect to remote storage called Elastic Block Store or EBS. EBS allows us to allocate volume which can be then allocated to EC2.
(+) Remember that EC2, Subnets, Network, and persistent stoarage are in an `Availability Zone`.
(+) Instances can have multiple interfaces even in different subnets, as long as they are in the same AZ.

`What is EC2 good for`
(+) Traditional `OS+Applciation` compute, for `long-running` compute.
(+) `Server` style application either `burst` or `steady-state load`.
(+) `Monolithic` application stacks
(+) `Migrated` application workloads or `disaster recovery`.

#### B. EC2 Instance Type
(+) EC2 Instance Type affects raw CPU, Memory, Local Storage Capacity & Type.
(+) `Resource Ratios` and `Storage` and `Data` network `bandwidth`.
(+) System Architecture/ Vendor, and additional features and capabilities.

###### 1. EC2 Categories
(+) `General Purpose` - Default - Diverse workloads, equal resource ratio.
(+) `Compute Optimized` - Media Processing, HPC, Scientific Modelling, gaming, ML.
(+) `Memory Optimized` - Processing large in-memory datasets, sone database workloads.
(+) `Accelerated Computing` - Hardware GPU, field programmable gate arrays (FPGAs).
(+) `Storage Optimized` - Sequential and random IO - sacle-out transactional databases, data warehousing, Elasticsearch, analytic workloads.

###### 2. Decoding EC2 Types

###### 3. Instance Pricing Models
(+) `On-Demand Instances:` Instances have an hourly rate, billed in `seconds` (60s minimum) or `Hourly` , no long-term commitments or upfront payments. Good for new or uncertain application requirements or `short-term`, `spiky`, `unpredictable` workloads which `can't tolerate any disruption`.

(+) `Spot Instance`: Spot pricing offers up to 90% off vs On-Demand. A spot price is set by EC2 - based on `spare capacity`. You can sprcify a `maximum price`, if spot price goes above yours `instance terminated`, therefore, it is only used for apps which `can tolerate failure`.

(+) `Reserved Instances`: up to 75% off vs On-demand - `for a commitment`. Buy 1 or 3 years in advance (all upfront, partial upfront, no upfront). `Reserved in region`, or AZ with capacity reservation. Good for `Known stady state usage`, low cost for apps which `cant handle disruption`.

###### Instance Status Checks and AutoRecovery
![[Pasted image 20240129143854.png]]

(+) The first one is the `System Status check` which indicate `Loss of System Power, Loss of network Connectivity, Host software issue, and host hardware issue` should it fails.

(+) The second one is the `Instance check` which indicate `corrupted file system, incorrect instance networking, OS Kernel issues` 

###### 4. Instance Metadata
(+) EC2 Service provides data to Instances, which is accessible inside ALL instance. Access via `http://169.254.169.254/latest/meta-data`.
(+) Stored information about the `Environment, Networking, Authentication, User-Data` of the instance. It is `not authenticated or encrypted`

###### 5. EC2 Dedicated Hosts
(+) EC2 host dedicated to you.
(+) Specific family e.g. a1, c5, m5
(+) `No instance charges`... you pay for the host
(+) On-demand & Reserved Options available.
(+) Host hardware has physical sockets and cores


#### C. EC2 Instance Roles
![[Pasted image 20240130144613.png]]

(+) Credentials are inside meta-data => `iam/security-credentials/role-name`
(+) Automatically rotated - always valid
(+) Should always be used rather than adding access keys into instances

#### D. EC2 Optimization
###### 1. Enhance networking
(+) Uses `SR-IOV` - NIC is virtualization aware
![[Pasted image 20240201150510.png]]
(+) No charge - available on most EC2 Types, with `Higher I/O, Lower Host CPU Usage` with more `Bandwidth`
(+) Higher packets-per-second (`PPS`), consistent lower `latency`.


###### 2. EBS Optimized
(+) `EBS` = block storage over the network.
(+) Historically network was `shared` .. `data` and `EBS`.
(+) EBS optimized means dedicated capacity for EBS.
(+) Most instances `support` and have `enabled by default`. Some support, but enabling costs extra.
