#### A. Functions of Layer 4
(+) Provides transparent transfer of data between end hosts
(+) Provides various services to applications:
	(-) Reliable data transfer
	(-) Error recovery
	(-) Data sequencing
	(-) Flow control
(+) Provides Layer 4 addressing (`port number`).
	==> Identify application layer protocol (TCP:80 => HTTP)
	==> Provides session multiplexing
	==> The following ranges have been designated by IANA
		(-) `Well-known` port numners: 0 -> 1023
		(-) `Registered` port numbers: 1024 -> 49151
		(-) `Ephemeral/private/ynamic` port number: 49152 -> 65535

#### B. Port Numbers / Session Multiplexing
(+) A session is an exchange of data between two or more communicating devices.

(+) Identify the Application Layer Protocol, provides session multiplexing
(+) The following ranges have been designated by IANA (Internet Assigned Numbers Authority)
==> `Well-known` port numbets: 0 - 1023
==> `Registered` port number: 1024 - 49151
==> `Ephemeral/private/dynamic` port number: 49152 - 65535

#### C. Transmission Control Protocol (TCP)
(+) TCP is connection-oriented, before sneding data to the destination, the two hosts communicate to establish a connection
(+) TCP provides reliable communication, the destination host must acknowledge that it received each TCP segment. If the segment is not acknowledged it is sent again
(+) TCP provide sequencing, which allow destination hosts to put segments in the corret order even if they arrive out of order.
(+) TCP provides flow control, the destination host can tell the source host to increase/decrease the rate of sending

**1. Source port - 16 bits**: Specifies the port number on the sending device that is used for the communication. Typically selected randomly from 1024 - 65535.

**2. Destination port - 16 bits**: Specifies the port number on the receiving device that is used for the communication.

**3. Sequence number - 32 bits**: Specifies the sequence number of the first byte of data in the segment. 

**4. Acknowledgment number - 32 bits**: Specifies the acknowledgment number of the next expected byte of data. This is used to acknowledge the receipt of data.

**5. Data offset - 4 bits**: Specifies the size of TCP header in 32-bit words.

**6. Reserved - 6 bits**: Unused bits that are reserved for future use.

**7. Control bits - 6 bits**: A set of bits that control various aspects of the TCP connection.
+ URG (Urgent pointer field)
+ ACK (AAcknowledgment number field)
+ PSH (push function)
+ RST (reset the connection)
+ SYN (synchronize sequence numbers)
+ FIN (no more data)

**8. Window size - 8 bits**: Specifies the number of bytes that the receiving device is willing to accept.

**9. Check sum - 8 bits**: A value that is calculated based on the contents of TCP used to detect errors.

**10. Urgent pointer - 8 bits**: Indicates whether the segment contains urgent data.

**11. Options**: additional field.

###### Three-way Handshake
![[Pasted image 20240404083300.png]]

(+) Host set a random initial sequence number
(+) `Forward acknowledgement` is used to indicate the sequence number of the next segment the host expects to receive

###### TCP retransmission

#### D. User Datagram Protocol
(+) UDP is `not` connection-oriented, no 3 way handshake
(+) UDP does not provide reliable communication, if segment is lost, it will not retransmit
(+) UDP does not provide sequencing
(+) UDP does not provide flow control

###### Comparision between UDP and TCP
(+) TCP provides more features than UDP, but at the cost of additional overhead
(+) For applications that require reliable communication (for example a file), TCP is preferred
(+) For applciations like real-time voice and video, UDP is preferred
(+) There are some applciations that use UDP, but provide reliability within the application itself
