#### A. Why IPv6
(+) The main reason is that `there simply aren't enough IPv4 address available`
(+) There are only 2^32 IPv4 address available
(+) VLSM, private IPv4 addresses, and NAT have been used to conserve the use of IPv4 address space
==> The long-term solution is IPv6

###### HOW IPv4 ARE ASSIGNED?
(+) IPv4 address assignment are controlled by IANA (Internet Assigned Numbers Authority)
(+) IANA distributes IPv4 address space to various RIRs (Regional Internet Registries), which then assign them to companies that need them

#### B. What is IPv6
(+) An IPv6 address is 128 bits, making it 2^128 address can be used

###### Shorten (abbreviating) IPv6 addresses
(+) Leading 0s can be removed
```
2001:0DB8:000A:001B:20A1:0020:0080:34BD
=> 2001:DB8:A:1B:20A1:20:80:34BD
```

(+) Consecutive quartets of all 0s can be replaced with a double colon (::)
```
2001:0DB8:0000:0000:0000:0000:0080:34BD
=> 2001:0DB8::0080:34BD
=> 2001:DB8::80:34BD
```

`NOTE THAT`: Consecutive quartets of 0s can only be abbreviated `once` in an IPv6 address.
```
2001:0000:0000:0000:20A1:0000:0000:34BD
=> 2001::20A1:0:0:34BD
```

#### C. FInding IPv6 Prefix (Global Unicast Address)
(+) Typically, an enterprise requesting IPv6 addresses from their `ISP will receive a /48 block`
(+) Typicall, IPv6 subnet use a /64 prefix length
(+) That means an enterprise has `16 bits` to use to make `subnets`
(+) An the rest `64 bits` can be used for hosts

#### D. Global Unicast Hierarchy
(+) Currently, only global unicast addresses with the first three bits of 001 or 2000::/3 are being assigned

(+) `IANA allocated space` is /16, `Registry prefix` is /23, `ISP prefix` is /32, `Site prefix` is /48, `subnet prefix` is /64
